Hello, good people of the internet! This text represents some initial forays of mine into blogging with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/ "Octopress"), composing in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown"), versioning with [Git](http://git-scm.com/ "Git"), and virtual hosting with [NGINX](http://nginx.com/ "NGINX"). As of the time of this writing, this site is hosted on a blazing fast SSD VPS courtesy of [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/ "Digital Ocean"). Protip: always check for [coupon codes](http://www.retailmenot.com/s/digitalocean "RetailMeNot").

I learned how to use Git via the excellent [try git](http://try.github.com/ "tryGit") tutorial. With some help from a fellow linux [enthusiast](http://thewonderfulworldoflinux.com/), I've configured Octopress to live on the server instead of my local machine for now. The very basic modification to make this happen is documented as a [commit](https://github.com/Teepareep/octopressin/commit/4969d157eebd97d4d3f083084981557779d7642f "github") on my public github repository. That I know how this commit was created and published is a source of great pride for me today. Git has been greek to me for far too long.

I'm composing this post with [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/ "iA Writer") using the nifty Focus Mode feature to help keep my eyes on the sentence I'm writing and not flitting about the page, wondering where I left off. It's the small things. The soundtrack to this post was [dark techno](http://secretthirteen.org/secret-thirteen-mix-061-yaporigami/ "Yaporigami") of the finest quality.
